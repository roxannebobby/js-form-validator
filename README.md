# Javascript Form Validator Project Information

This project uses HTML, CSS and Javascript to develop a custom form that validates existence of content, formatting of email address, and validation of password entries. Error messages display when a problem is detected and fields are highlighted with a green border upon successful submission.

The project was developed utlizing a tutorial by Brad Traversy. When possible my code strays from the tutorial to practice the skills taught in the lesson.
